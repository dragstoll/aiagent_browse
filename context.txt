 Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. Known for her autobiographical songwriting, artistic versatility, and cultural impact, Swift is one of the world's best-selling music artists and has a record seven albums that each sold one million copies first-week in the US. She is the highest-grossing touring artist, the richest female musician, and the first billionaire with music as the primary source of income.
 Swift signed to Big Machine Records in 2005, debuting as a country singer with the albums Taylor Swift (2006) and Fearless (2008). The singles "Teardrops on My Guitar", "Love Story", and "You Belong with Me" found crossover success on country and pop radio formats. She incorporated rock on Speak Now (2010) and electronic on Red (2012), later re-calibrating her image from country to pop with the synth-pop set 1989 (2014); the ensuing media scrutiny inspired the hip-hop-imbued Reputation (2017). The albums contained the Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together", "Shake It Off", "Blank Space", "Bad Blood", and "Look What You Made Me Do".
 Shifting to Republic Records in 2018, Swift released the electropop album Lover (2019) and explored indie folk styles in the 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore. She experimented with subdued pop genres on Midnights (2022) and The Tortured Poets Department (2024), and began re-recording her Big Machine albums as Taylor's Version[a] due to an ownership dispute with the label. Through the 2020s, she garnered the US number-one songs "Cardigan", "Willow", "All Too Well", "Anti-Hero", "Cruel Summer", "Is It Over Now?", and "Fortnight". She has embarked on six concert tours, including the Eras Tour (2023–2024), the highest-grossing tour of all time. Her films include Miss Americana (2020), All Too Well: The Short Film (2021), and The Eras Tour (2023)—the highest-grossing concert film.
 A prominent figure in popular music, Swift has received extensive media coverage and has a global fanbase known as Swifties. Swift has been listed amongst history's greatest artists by publications such as Rolling Stone and Billboard, as well as the only individual from the arts to have been named the Time Person of the Year (2023). Her accolades include 14 Grammy Awards (including a record four Album of the Year wins), a Primetime Emmy Award, and a record five IFPI Global Recording Artist of the Year awards. Swift is the most-awarded artist of the American Music Awards (40), the Billboard Music Awards (49), and the MTV Video Music Awards (30).
 Taylor Alison Swift was born on December 13, 1989, in West Reading, Pennsylvania.[1] She is named after the singer-songwriter James Taylor.[2][3] Her father, Scott Kingsley Swift, was a stockbroker for Merrill Lynch, and her mother, Andrea Gardner Swift (née Finlay), worked as a mutual fund marketing executive.[4] Swift's younger brother, Austin, is an actor.[5]  The siblings are of Scottish, English, and German descent, with distant Italian and Irish ancestry.[6][7][8] Their maternal grandmother, Marjorie Finlay (née Moehlenkamp), was an opera singer,[9] whose singing in church became one of Swift's earliest memories of music that shaped her career.[4]
 Swift spent her early years on a Christmas tree farm in Pennsylvania that her father had purchased from one of his clients,[10] and she spent her summers at her family's vacation home in Stone Harbor, New Jersey, where she occasionally performed acoustic songs at a local coffee shop.[11] She is Christian[12] and attended preschool and kindergarten at a Montessori school run by the Bernardine Sisters of St. Francis before transferring to the Wyndcroft School.[13][14] When her family moved to Wyomissing, she attended Wyomissing Area Junior/Senior High School.[15][16] As a child, she performed in Berks Youth Theatre Academy productions[17] and traveled regularly to New York City for vocal and acting lessons.[18] Her early love for country music was influenced by Shania Twain, Patsy Cline, LeAnn Rimes, and the Dixie Chicks,[14] and she spent weekends performing at local festivals and events.[19][20] After watching a documentary about Faith Hill, she became determined to pursue a country music career in Nashville, Tennessee.[21]
 At 11, Swift traveled to Nashville with her mother to visit record labels and submit demo tapes of Dolly Parton and Dixie Chicks karaoke covers.[22] She was rejected by all the labels, which led her to focus on songwriting.[23] She started learning the guitar at 12 with the help of Ronnie Cremer, a computer repairman and local musician who also assisted Swift with writing an original song.[24] In 2003, Swift and her parents started working with the talent manager Dan Dymtrow. With his help, Swift modeled for Abercrombie & Fitch and had an original song included on a Maybelline compilation CD.[25] After performing original songs at an RCA Records showcase, 13-year-old Swift was given an artist development deal and began to travel regularly to Nashville with her mother.[26][27] To help Swift break into the country music scene, her father transferred to Merrill Lynch's Nashville office when she was 14 years old, and the family relocated to Hendersonville, Tennessee.[28][29] Swift attended Hendersonville High School[30] before transferring to Aaron Academy after two years, which better accommodated her touring schedule through homeschooling. She graduated one year early.[3][31]
 In Nashville, Swift worked with experienced Music Row songwriters such as Troy Verges, Brett Beavers, Brett James, Mac McAnally, and the Warren Brothers[32][33] and formed a lasting working relationship with Liz Rose.[34] They began meeting for two-hour writing sessions every Tuesday afternoon after school.[35] Rose called the sessions "some of the easiest I've ever done. Basically, I was just her editor. She'd write about what happened in school that day. She had such a clear vision of what she was trying to say. And she'd come in with the most incredible hooks." At 14, Swift became the youngest artist signed by Sony/ATV Tree Music Publishing.[36] She left RCA Records due to the label's lack of care and their "cut[ting] other people's stuff". She was also concerned that development deals can shelve artists[27][20] and recalled: "I genuinely felt that I was running out of time. I wanted to capture these years of my life on an album while they still represented what I was going through."[37]
 At an industry showcase at Nashville's Bluebird Cafe in 2005, Swift caught the attention of Scott Borchetta, a DreamWorks Records executive who was preparing to form an independent record label, Big Machine Records. She had first met Borchetta in 2004.[39] She was one of Big Machine's first signings,[27] and her father purchased a three-percent stake in the company for an estimated $120,000.[40][41][42] She began working on her eponymous debut album with Nathan Chapman.[20] Swift wrote or co-wrote all album tracks, and co-writers included Rose, Robert Ellis Orrall, Brian Maher, and Angelo Petraglia.[43] Released in October 2006, Taylor Swift peaked at number five on the US Billboard 200, on which it spent 157 weeks—the longest stay on the chart by any release in the US in the 2000s decade.[44][45] Swift became the first female country music artist to write or co-write every track on a platinum-certified debut album.[46]
 Big Machine Records was still in its infancy during the June 2006 release of the lead single, "Tim McGraw", which Swift and her mother helped promote by packaging and sending copies of the CD single to country radio stations.[47] She spent much of 2006 promoting Taylor Swift with a radio tour and television appearances; she opened for Rascal Flatts on select dates during their 2006 tour,[48] as a replacement for Eric Church.[49] Borchetta said that although record industry peers initially disapproved of his signing a 15-year-old singer-songwriter, Swift tapped into a previously unknown market—teenage girls who listen to country music.[47][28]
 Following "Tim McGraw", four more singles were released throughout 2007 and 2008: "Teardrops on My Guitar", "Our Song", "Picture to Burn", and "Should've Said No". All appeared on Billboard's Hot Country Songs, with "Our Song" and "Should've Said No" reaching number one. "Our Song" made Swift the youngest person to single-handedly write and sing a Hot Country Songs number-one single,[50] and "Teardrops on My Guitar" was Swift's breakthrough single on mainstream radio and charts.[51][52][53] Swift released two EPs, The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection in October 2007 and Beautiful Eyes in July 2008.[54][55] She promoted her debut album extensively as the opening act for other country musicians' tours in 2006 and 2007, including those by George Strait,[56] Brad Paisley,[57] and Tim McGraw and Faith Hill.[58]
 Swift won multiple accolades for Taylor Swift. She was one of the recipients of the Nashville Songwriters Association's Songwriter/Artist of the Year in 2007, becoming the youngest person given the title.[59] She also won the Country Music Association's Horizon Award for Best New Artist,[60] the Academy of Country Music Awards' Top New Female Vocalist,[61] and the American Music Awards' Favorite Country Female Artist honor.[62] She was also nominated for Best New Artist at the 50th Annual Grammy Awards.[63] In 2008, she opened for Rascal Flatts again[64] and briefly dated the singer Joe Jonas.[65]
 Swift's second studio album, Fearless, was released in November 2008 in North America,[66] and in March 2009 in other markets.[67] On the Billboard 200, Fearless spent 11 weeks at number one, becoming Swift's first chart topper and the longest-running number-one female country album.[68] It was the bestselling album of 2009 in the US.[69] Its lead single, "Love Story", was her first number one in Australia and the first country song to top Billboard's Pop Songs chart,[70][71] and its third single, "You Belong with Me", was the first country song to top Billboard's all-genre Radio Songs chart.[72] Three other singles were released in 2008–2010: "White Horse", "Fifteen", and "Fearless". All five singles were Hot Country Songs top 10 entries, with "Love Story" and "You Belong with Me" topping the chart.[73] In 2009, Swift toured as an opening act for Keith Urban and embarked on her first headlining tour, the Fearless Tour.[74]
 "You Belong with Me" won Best Female Video at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards.[75] Her acceptance speech was interrupted by the rapper Kanye West, an incident that became the subject of controversy and widespread media coverage.[76] That year, Swift won five American Music Awards, including Artist of the Year and Favorite Country Album.[77] Billboard named her the 2009 Artist of the Year.[78] She won Video of the Year and Female Video of the Year for "Love Story" at the 2009 CMT Music Awards, where she made a parody video of the song with rapper T-Pain called "Thug Story".[79] At the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards, Fearless was named Album of the Year and Best Country Album, and "White Horse" won Best Country Song and Best Female Country Vocal Performance.[80] At the 2009 Country Music Association Awards, Swift won Album of the Year for Fearless and was named Entertainer of the Year, the youngest person to win the honor.[81]
 Throughout 2009, Swift featured on and wrote other musicians' releases. She featured on "Half of My Heart" by John Mayer, whom she was romantically linked with in late 2009.[82][83] She wrote "Best Days of Your Life" for Kellie Pickler,[84] co-wrote and featured on Boys Like Girls' "Two Is Better Than One,[85] and wrote two songs—"You'll Always Find Your Way Back Home" and "Crazier"—for the soundtrack of Hannah Montana: The Movie, in which she had a cameo appearance.[86][87] She wrote and recorded "Today Was a Fairytale" for the soundtrack of Valentine's Day (2010), in which she had her acting debut.[88] "Today Was a Fairytale" was her first number-one single on the Canadian Hot 100.[89] While shooting Valentine's Day in October 2009, Swift dated co-star Taylor Lautner.[90] On television, she made her debut as a rebellious teenager in an CSI: Crime Scene Investigation episode[91] and hosted and performed as the musical guest on Saturday Night Live; she was the first host ever to write their own opening monologue.[92][93]
 Swift's third studio album, Speak Now, was released in October 2010.[94] Written solely by Swift,[95] the album debuted the Billboard 200 with over one million US copies sold first week[96] and became the fastest-selling digital album by a female artist.[97] Speak Now was supported by six singles: "Mine", "Back to December", "Mean", "The Story of Us", "Sparks Fly", and "Ours". "Mine" peaked at number three and was the highest-charting single on the Billboard Hot 100,[98] the first three singles reached the top 10 in Canada,[89] and the last two reached number one on Hot Country Songs.[73] Swift promoted Speak Now with the Speak Now World Tour from February 2011 to March 2012[99] and the live album Speak Now World Tour – Live.[100]
At the 54th Annual Grammy Awards in 2012, Swift performed "Mean", which won Best Country Song and Best Country Solo Performance.[101] She was named Songwriter/Artist of the Year by the Nashville Songwriters Association (2010 and 2011),[102][103] Woman of the Year by Billboard (2011),[104] and Entertainer of the Year by the Academy of Country Music (2011 and 2012)[105] and the Country Music Association in 2011.[106] At the American Music Awards of 2011, Swift won Artist of the Year and Favorite Country Album.[107] Rolling Stone named Speak Now on its list of "50 Best Female Albums of All Time" (2012).[108]
 Red, Swift's fourth studio album, was released in October 2012.[109] On Red, Swift worked with Chapman and new producers including Max Martin, Shellback, Dan Wilson, Jeff Bhasker, Dann Huff, and Butch Walker, resulting in a genre-spanning record that incorporated eclectic styles of pop and rock such as Britrock, dubstep, and dance-pop.[110][111] The album opened at number one on the Billboard 200 with 1.21 million sales[112] and was Swift's first number-one album in the UK.[113] Its lead single, "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together", was her first number one on the Billboard Hot 100,[114] and its third single, "I Knew You Were Trouble", reached the top five on charts worldwide.[115] Other singles from Red were "Begin Again", "22", "Everything Has Changed", "The Last Time", and "Red".[116]
 Red and its single "Begin Again" received three nominations at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards (2014).[117] Swift received American Music Awards for Best Female Country Artist in 2012, Artist of the Year in 2013,[118][119] and the Nashville Songwriters Association's Songwriter/Artist Award for the fifth and sixth consecutive years.[120] At the 2014 Country Music Association Awards, Swift was honored with the Pinnacle Award, making her the second recipient in history after Garth Brooks.[121] The Red Tour ran from March 2013 to June 2014 and became the highest-grossing country tour upon completion.[122]
 Swift continued writing songs for films and featuring on other artists' releases. On the soundtrack album to The Hunger Games (2012), Swift wrote and recorded "Eyes Open" and "Safe & Sound"; the latter of which was co-written with the Civil Wars and T-Bone Burnett. "Safe & Sound" won the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media.[123] She wrote and produced "Sweeter than Fiction" with Jack Antonoff for the soundtrack to One Chance (2013).[124] Swift featured on B.o.B's "Both of Us" (2012)[125] and provided vocals for Tim McGraw's "Highway Don't Care" (2013), also featuring Keith Urban.[126] She was a voice actress in The Lorax (2012),[127] made a cameo in the sitcom New Girl (2013),[128] and had a supporting role in the dystopian film The Giver (2014).[129] From 2010 to 2013, Swift was romantically involved with the actor Jake Gyllenhaal, the political heir Conor Kennedy, and the singer Harry Styles.[83]
 In March 2014, Swift began living in New York City, which she credited as a creative influence on her fifth studio album, 1989.[note 1] She described 1989 as her first "official pop album" and produced it with Jack Antonoff, Max Martin, Shellback, Imogen Heap, Ryan Tedder, and Ali Payami.[132] Released in October 2014, the album opened atop the Billboard 200 with 1.28 million copies sold.[133] Its singles "Shake It Off", "Blank Space", and "Bad Blood" reached number one in Australia, Canada, and the US, with the first two making Swift the first woman to replace herself at the Hot 100 top spot.[134] Other singles include "Style", "Wildest Dreams", "Out of the Woods", and "New Romantics".[135] The 1989 World Tour (2015) was the highest-grossing tour of the year with $250 million in total revenue.[136]
 After publishing an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal stressing the importance of albums as a creative medium for artists,[137] in November 2014, Swift removed her catalog from ad-supported, free music streaming platforms such as Spotify.[138] In a June 2015 open letter, Swift criticized Apple Music for not offering royalties to artists during its free three-month trial period and threatened to withdraw her music from the platform,[139] which prompted Apple Inc. to announce that it would pay artists during the free trial period.[140] Swift then agreed to keep 1989 and her catalog on Apple Music.[141] Big Machine Records returned Swift's catalog to Spotify among other free streaming platforms in June 2017.[142]
 Swift was named Billboard's Woman of the Year in 2014, becoming the first artist to win the award twice.[143] At the 2014 American Music Awards, Swift received the inaugural Dick Clark Award for Excellence.[144] On her 25th birthday in 2014, the Grammy Museum at L.A. Live opened an exhibit in her honor in Los Angeles that ran until October 4, 2015.[145][146] In 2015, Swift won the Brit Award for International Female Solo Artist.[147] "Bad Blood" won Video of the Year and Best Collaboration at the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards.[148] At the 58th Grammy Awards (2016), 1989 won Album of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album, making Swift the first woman to win Album of the Year twice.[149]
 Swift dated the DJ Calvin Harris from March 2015 to June 2016.[150] They co-wrote the song "This Is What You Came For", featuring vocals from Rihanna; Swift was initially credited under the pseudonym Nils Sjöberg.[151] She recorded "I Don't Wanna Live Forever" with Zayn Malik for the soundtrack to Fifty Shades Darker (2017)[152] and won a Country Music Association Award for Song of the Year with "Better Man", which she wrote for the band Little Big Town.[153] In April 2016, Kanye West released the single "Famous", in which he references Swift in the line, "I made that bitch famous." Swift criticized West and said she never consented to the lyric, but West claimed that he had received her approval and his then-wife Kim Kardashian released video clips of Swift and West discussing the song amicably over the phone. The controversy made Swift a subject of an online "cancel" movement.[154] In late 2016, after briefly dating Tom Hiddleston, Swift began a six-year relationship with Joe Alwyn and retreated herself from the public spotlight.[155][156]
 In August 2017, Swift successfully countersued David Mueller, a former radio jockey for KYGO-FM, who sued her for damages from loss of employment. Four years earlier, she informed Mueller's bosses that he had sexually assaulted her by groping her at an event.[157] The public controversies influenced Swift's sixth studio album, Reputation, which explored the impact of her fame and musically incorporated electropop with urban styles of hip hop and R&B.[158] Released in November 2017,[159] Reputation opened atop the Billboard 200 with 1.21 million US sales[160] and topped the charts in the UK, Australia, and Canada.[161] The album's lead single, "Look What You Made Me Do", was Swift's first UK number-one single[162] and topped charts in Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, and the US.[163] Its singles "...Ready for It?", "End Game", and "Delicate" were released to pop radio.[164] Reputation was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album.[165] Swift featured on the country duo Sugarland's "Babe" (2018).[166]
 At the 2018 American Music Awards, Swift won four awards, which made her accumulate 23 trophies in total and become the AMAs' most awarded female musician, surpassing Whitney Houston.[167] The same year, she embarked on her Reputation Stadium Tour,[168] which became the highest-grossing North American concert tour in history and grossed $345.7 million worldwide.[169]
 In November 2018, Swift signed a new deal with Universal Music Group, which promoted her subsequent albums under Republic Records' imprint.[170] The contract included a provision for Swift to maintain ownership of her masters. In addition, in the event that Universal sold any part of its stake in Spotify, it agreed to distribute a non-recoupable portion of the proceeds among its artists.[171][172]
 Swift's first album with Republic Records, Lover, was released in August 2019.[173] She produced the album with Antonoff, Louis Bell, Frank Dukes, and Joel Little.[174] Lover peaked atop the charts of such countries as Australia, Canada, Ireland, Mexico, Norway, Sweden, the UK, and the US.[175] The album spawned five singles: "Me!", "You Need to Calm Down", "Lover", "The Man", and "Cruel Summer"; the first two singles peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100, and the lattermost single became a resurgent success in 2023, reaching number one.[176] Lover was 2019's best selling album in the US and best selling album by a solo artist worldwide.[177] The album and its singles earned three nominations at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards in 2020.[178] At the 2019 MTV Video Music Awards, Swift won three awards including Video of the Year for "You Need to Calm Down", becoming the first female and second artist overall to win the category for a self-directed video.[179]
 While promoting Lover in 2019, Swift became embroiled in a public dispute with the talent manager Scooter Braun after he purchased Big Machine Records, including the masters of her albums that the label had released.[180] Swift said she had been trying to buy the masters, but Big Machine would allow her to do so only if she exchanged one new album for each older one under a new contract, which she refused to sign.[180] In November 2020, Swift began re-recording her back catalog, which enabled her to own the new masters and the licensing of her songs for commercial use, substituting for the Big Machine-owned masters.[181]
 In February 2020, Swift signed a global publishing deal with Universal Music Publishing Group after her 16-year contract with Sony/ATV expired.[182] Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Swift surprise-released two "sister albums" that she recorded and produced with Antonoff and Aaron Dessner: Folklore in July and Evermore in December.[183] Joe Alwyn co-wrote and co-produced a few songs under the pseudonym William Bowery.[184] Both albums incorporated a muted indie folk production;[185] each was supported by three singles catering to US pop, country, and triple A radio formats. The singles were "Cardigan", "Betty", and "Exile" from Folklore, and "Willow", "No Body, No Crime", and "Coney Island" from Evermore.[186] Folklore was the bestselling album of 2020 in the US[187] and, together with "Cardigan", made Swift the first artist to debut a US number-one album and a number-one song in the same week; she achieved the feat again with Evermore and "Willow".[188]
 According to Billboard, Swift was the highest-paid musician in the US and highest-paid solo musician worldwide of 2020.[189] Folklore made Swift the first woman to win the Grammy Award for Album of the Year three times, winning the category at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards (2021).[190] At the American Music Awards, Swift won three awards including Artist of the Year for a third record time (2020)[191] and Favorite Pop/Rock Female Artist and Favorite Pop/Rock Album (2021).[192] Swift played Bombalurina in the film adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical Cats (2019), for which she co-wrote and recorded the Golden Globe-nominated original song "Beautiful Ghosts".[193][194] The documentary Miss Americana, which chronicled parts of Swift's life and career, premiered at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival.[195]
 
Swift's re-recordings of her first six studio albums began with Fearless (Taylor's Version) and Red (Taylor's Version), which were released in April and November 2021. Both peaked atop the Billboard 200, and the former was the first re-recorded album to do so.[196] Fearless (Taylor's Version) was preceded by "Love Story (Taylor's Version)", which made Swift the second artist after Dolly Parton to have both the original and re-recorded versions of a song reach number one on Hot Country Songs.[197] Red (Taylor's Version) was supported by "All Too Well (10 Minute Version)", which became the longest song in history to top the Hot 100.[198] Swift's tenth studio album, Midnights, was released in October 2022.[199] The album incorporates a restrained electropop[200] and synth-pop sound[201] with elements of hip hop, R&B, and electronica.[199][202] In the US, Midnights was her fifth to open atop the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of over one million copies, and its tracks, led by the single "Anti-Hero", made Swift the first artist to monopolize the top 10 of the Hot 100.[203] Globally, the album broke the record for the most single-day streams and most single-week streams on Spotify and peaked atop the charts of at least 14 countries.[204] The album's two further singles, "Lavender Haze" and "Karma", both peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100.[205]
 According to Billboard, Swift was the top-earning solo artist in the US and the top-earning musician worldwide of 2021.[206][207] She won six American Music Awards including Artist of the Year in 2022.[208] At the MTV Video Music Awards, Swift won her third and fourth trophies for Video of the Year with All Too Well: The Short Film, her self-directed short film that accompanies "All Too Well (10 Minute Version)", in 2022[209] and "Anti-Hero" in 2023.[210] During this period, Swift won three Grammy Awards: Best Music Video for All Too Well: The Short Film[211] and Best Pop Vocal Album and Album of the Year for Midnights. Swift became the first artist to win Album of the Year four times in Grammy history.[212]
 Swift's next two re-recorded albums, Speak Now (Taylor's Version) and 1989 (Taylor's Version), were released in July and October 2023. The former made Swift the woman with the most number-one albums (12) in Billboard 200 history, surpassing Barbra Streisand,[213] and the latter was her sixth album to sell one million copies in a single week in the US, claiming her career's largest album sales week.[214] 1989 (Taylor's Version)'s single "Is It Over Now?" peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100.[215] Swift featured on Big Red Machine's "Renegade" and "Birch" (2021),[216] Haim's "Gasoline" (2021),[217] Ed Sheeran's "The Joker and the Queen" (2022),[218] and the National's "The Alcott" (2023).[219] For the soundtrack of the film Where the Crawdads Sing (2022), she wrote and recorded "Carolina", which received nominations for Best Original Song at the Golden Globes and Best Song Written for Visual Media at the Grammy Awards.[220] Besides music, Swift had a supporting role in the period comedy film Amsterdam (2022).[221]
 In 2023, Swift was the most streamed artist on Spotify,[222] Apple Music,[223] and Amazon Music;[224] and the first act to place number one on the year-end Billboard top artists list in three different decades (2009, 2015 and 2023).[225] She had five out of the 10 best-selling albums of 2023 in the US, a record since Luminate began tracking US music sales in 1991.[226]
 In March 2023, Swift embarked on the Eras Tour, a retrospective tour covering all her studio albums. Media outlets extensively covered the tour's global cultural and economic impact,[227] and its US leg broke the record for the most tickets sold in a day.[203] Ticketmaster received public and political criticisms for mishandling the tour's ticket sales.[228] The Eras Tour became the highest-grossing tour in history.[229][230] Its concert film, released to theaters worldwide on October 13, 2023, grossed over $250 million to become the highest-grossing concert film and was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Cinematic and Box Office Achievement.[231][232] A photobook, The Eras Tour Book, was released on November 29, 2024, and sold over a million copies in its first week in the US alone.[233]
 Swift's eleventh studio album, The Tortured Poets Department, was released on April 19, 2024.[234] Topping charts globally, the album broke a string of records: it marked the first album ever to amass 1 billion Spotify streams in a week; sold 2.6 million units in its first week in the US; made Swift the first artist to monopolize the top 14 of the Billboard Hot 100 and the top 10 of Australia's ARIA Singles Chart; and went on to spend 17 weeks atop the Billboard 200—Swift's longest-running number-one album on the chart. The lead single, "Fortnight", featuring Post Malone, became Swift's 12th number-one song on the Hot 100.[235][236][237]
 After the pandemic, Swift's music releases, touring, and related activities culminated in an unprecedented height of popularity.[238] From 2023 onward, Swift found ubiquitous success, albeit more dominant than before, with the successes of the re-recordings, the Eras Tour, its concert film, Midnights, and The Tortured Poets Department, significantly increasing her net worth; Music Business Worldwide remarked this as a "new stratosphere of global career success" for Swift.[239][240] In 2023, she began dating the American football player Travis Kelce,[241] and in 2024, won Artist of the Year at the 2024 iHeartRadio Music Awards.[242] Swift was Spotify's most streamed artist once again in 2024.[243][244]
 In January 2024, AI-generated fake pornographic images portraying Swift were posted to Twitter and spread to other social media platforms, spurring criticism and demands for legal reform.[245] In July, Swift and Kelce received death threats from a stalker in Gelsenkirchen, Germany,[246] and three children were killed in a stabbing attack at a Swift-themed workshop in Southport, England, leading to civil unrest in the UK.[247] In August, all three of the Eras Tour concerts in Vienna were canceled following the arrest of two suspects for allegedly planning an Islamic State-inspired terrorist attack in the city. The plan was uncovered by US intelligence and was thwarted by Austrian police forces.[248]
 Swift has ventured into diverse genres throughout her career, including pop,[b] country,[c] folk,[d] rock,[e] and alternative music.[f] Her early musical influences were 1990s female country musicians such as Shania Twain, Faith Hill, LeAnn Rimes, and the Dixie Chicks,[265] and Keith Urban's country crossover sounds incorporating rock, pop, and blues.[266] She self-identified as a country musician and achieved prominence as a country pop singer with her first four studio albums, from Taylor Swift to Red.[267] The albums feature country signifiers such as banjo, six-string banjo, mandolin, fiddle, and a slight vocal twang, in addition to pop melodies and rock influences;[268][269] Speak Now draws on rock styles such as pop rock, pop-punk, and 1980s arena rock.[95][270] Critics argued that country was an indicator of Swift's narrative songwriting rather than musical direction[271][272] and accused her of causing mainstream country music to stray from its roots.[273][274]
 After the critical debate around Red's eclectic pop, rock, and electronic styles, Swift chose 1980s synth-pop as a defining sound of her recalibrated pop artistry and image, inspired by the music of Phil Collins, Annie Lennox, Peter Gabriel, and Madonna.[275][276] 1989, the first album in this direction, incorporates electronic arrangements consisting of dense synthesizers and drum machines.[277] Swift expanded on the electronic production on her next albums;[278] Reputation consists of hip hop, R&B, and EDM influences;[158][279] and Lover features eclectic elements from country, pop-punk, and folk rock.[280] When Swift embraced a pop identity, rockist critics regarded her move as an erosion of her country music songwriting authenticity,[281] but others regarded it as necessary for Swift's artistic evolution and defended her as a pioneer of poptimism.[282][283]
 Her 2020 alternative albums Folklore and Evermore explore indie styles of rock and folk, and both incorporate a subtle, stripped-back soundscape with orchestration, synthesizers, and drum pads.[264][284][285] The latter experiments with varied song structures, asymmetric time signatures, and diverse instruments.[286][287] Critics deemed the indie styles a mature representation of Swift's artistry as a singer-songwriter.[285] Midnights and The Tortured Poets Department both incorporate a minimalist, subdued synth-pop sound, making use of analog synthesizers, sustained bass notes, and simple drum machine patterns.[288][289]
 With continuous musical reinventions,[290] Swift was described by Time and the BBC as a musical "chameleon".[291][292] Jody Rosen commented that by originating her career in Nashville, Swift made a "bait-and-switch maneuver, planting roots in loamy country soil, then pivoting to pop".[293] Clash wrote that she has the versatility to "no longer [...] be defined by any genre or sound label".[294] According to Ann Powers, Swift's sound is genre-agnostic, blending and "reconfiguring" elements of country, R&B, indie pop, and hip hop.[295][296]
 Swift possesses a mezzo-soprano vocal range[301] and a generally soft and breathy timbre that Rolling Stone deemed versatile.[302][303] Reviews of Swift's early country albums criticized her vocals as weak and strained compared to those of other female country singers.[304] Despite the criticism, most reviewers appreciated that Swift refrained from correcting her pitch with Auto-Tune and how she prioritized "intimacy over power and nuance" to communicate the messages of her songs with her audience[305]—a style that has been described as conversational.[306][307] According to Powers, Swift's defining vocal feature was her attention to detail to convey an exact feeling—"the line that slides down like a contented sigh or up like a raised eyebrow".[308]
 On Red and 1989, Swift's vocals are electronically processed to accompany the pop production.[309][306] Her voice on Reputation and Midnights incorporates hip-hop and R&B influences that result in a near-rap delivery which emphasizes rhythm and cadence over melody.[310][295] She uses her lower register vocals extensively in "Cardigan"[311] and both her lower and upper registers in Evermore; the musicologist Alyssa Barca described her timbre in the upper register as "breathy and bright" and the lower register as "full and dark".[287]
 Reviews in The New York Times, Variety and The Atlantic were more appreciative of Swift's vocals in her later albums.[269][312][313][314] She ranked 102nd on Rolling Stone's 2023 list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time: "A decade ago, including her on this list would have been a controversial move, but recent releases like Folklore, Evermore, and Midnights officially settled the argument."[303] Laura Snapes of The Guardian said that Swift's "vocal trademarks" include a "yo-yoing vocal yelp" and "climactic, processed cri de coeur".[315] Amanda Petrusich praised how the clarity and tone of Swift's live vocals accentuate her lyrics.[316]
 Swift's fascination with songwriting began in her childhood. She credited her mother with igniting confidence and early songwriting interests by helping her prepare for class presentations.[317][318] She enjoyed Disney film soundtracks and would make up lyrics once she had run out of words singing them.[319] Her lyrical influences include female country songwriters such as Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, Tammy Wynette, and Dolly Parton;[19][104] 1990s songwriters such as Melissa Etheridge, Sarah McLachlan, and Alanis Morissette;[320] Joni Mitchell;[321] and Fall Out Boy.[322] She listed Paul McCartney, Bruce Springsteen, Emmylou Harris, and Kris Kristofferson as career role models, citing their both evolving and consistent songwriting outputs.[28][323] Her literary influences include the authors William Shakespeare, Nathaniel Hawthorne, F. Scott Fitzgerald,[324] and the poets William Wordsworth, Robert Frost, and Emily Dickinson;[325] the last of whom was a distant cousin of Swift.[326]
 In The New Yorker in 2011, Swift said she identifies as a songwriter first: "I write songs, and my voice is just a way to get those lyrics across".[28] Her personal experiences were a common inspiration for her early songs, which helped her navigate life.[327][29] Her "diaristic" technique began with identifying an emotion, followed by a corresponding melody.[328][329] On her first three studio albums, love, heartbreak, and insecurities, from an adolescent perspective, were dominant themes.[95][330] She delved into the tumult of toxic relationships on Red,[331] and embraced nostalgia and post-romance positivity on 1989.[275] Reputation was inspired by the downsides of Swift's fame,[332] and Lover detailed her realization of the "full spectrum of love".[333] Other themes in Swift's music include family dynamics, friendship,[334][335] alienation, self-awareness, and tackling vitriol, especially sexism.[318][336] She often references or draws inspiration from historical events and figures.[337] Neil McCormick, the chief music critic of The Daily Telegraph, opined that Swift is a "significant vehicle for expressing the inner lives and day-to-day concerns of women of her generation [and younger]".[338]
 Swift's confessional lyrics received positive reviews from critics,[339][28][340] who highlighted their vivid details and emotional engagement, which they found uncommon in pop music,[341][342][343] although some perceived her as a fragile, juvenile artist, a label she has consistently challenged.[339] Critics also praised her melodic compositions; Rolling Stone described Swift as "a songwriting savant with an intuitive gift for verse-chorus-bridge architecture".[344][306] NPR dubbed Swift "a master of the vernacular in her lyrics",[158] remarking that her songs offer emotional engagement because "the wit and clarity of her arrangements turn them from standard fare to heartfelt disclosures".[306] Despite the positive reception, The New Yorker stated she was generally portrayed "more as a skilled technician than as a Dylanesque visionary".[28] Tabloid media often speculated and linked the subjects of her songs with her ex-lovers, a practice reviewers and Swift herself criticized as sexist.[345][346][347] Aside from clues in album liner notes, Swift avoided talking about the subjects of her songs.[348]
 On her 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore, Swift was inspired by escapism and romanticism to explore fictional narratives.[349] She imposed emotions onto imagined characters and story arcs, which liberated her from tabloid attention and suggested new paths for her artistry.[328] Swift explained that she welcomed the new songwriting direction after she stopped worrying about commercial success.[349] According to Spin, she explored complex emotions with "precision and devastation" on Evermore.[350] Consequence stated her 2020 albums convinced skeptics of her songwriting prowess, noting her transformation from "teenage wunderkind to a confident and careful adult".[351]
 Swift divides her writing into three types: "quill lyrics", songs rooted in antiquated poeticism; "fountain pen lyrics", based on modern and vivid storylines; and "glitter gel pen lyrics", which are lively and frivolous.[352] Fans noticed that the fifth track of every Swift album was the most emotionally vulnerable of the album.[353] Awarding her with the Songwriter Icon Award in 2021, the National Music Publishers' Association remarked that "no one is more influential when it comes to writing music today".[354] The Week deemed her the foremost female songwriter of modern times,[355] and the Nashville Songwriters Association International named her Songwriter-Artist of the Decade in 2022.[203] Swift has also published two original poems: "Why She Disappeared" and "If You're Anything Like Me".[356]
 Critics have analyzed the distinctive qualities and thematic depth in Swift's songwriting. Critic Kitty Empire opined in 2024 that Swift is "a profoundly old-fashioned artist", whose songs "tell a story, in succinct, emotive ways that often scan meticulously" unlike most pop music of the time; Empire attributed it to Swift's country beginnings.[357] Swift's bridges are often noted as one of the best aspects of her songs,[358][351] earning her the title "Queen of Bridges" from Time.[359] Mojo dubbed her "a sharp narrator with a gift for the extended metaphor".[360] Academics have variably described her as a poet laureate,[361] philosopher,[362] and bard.[293]
 Swift commands large audiences on stage,[363][364][365] captivating them through emotional storytelling and vocal delivery rather than relying on elaborate dance choreography.[366] According to V magazine's Greg Krelenstein, she possesses "a rare gift of turning a stadium spectacle into an intimate setting", irrespective of whether she is "plucking a guitar or leading an army of dancers".[367] In a 2008 review of Swift's early performances, Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker called Swift a "preternaturally skilled" entertainer with a vibrant stage presence, adding "she returned the crowd's energy with the professionalism she has shown since the age of fourteen."[272] In 2023, Adrian Horton of The Guardian noted her "seemingly endless stamina" on the Eras Tour,[368] and i critic Ilana Kaplan called her showmanship "unparalleled".[369]
 Swift's concert productions have been characterized by elaborate Broadway theatricality and high technology,[370] and her performances frequently incorporate a live band, with whom she has played and toured since 2007.[371] Swift also often accompanies herself with musical instruments such as electric guitar;[372] acoustic guitar; piano;[373] and sometimes twelve-string guitar,[374][375] six-string banjo,[376] or ukulele.[377] Interacting frequently with the audience, her solo acoustic performances are considered intimate and emotionally resonant, complementing her story-based lyrics and fan connection.[316][378] Lydia Burgham of The Spinoff opined that this intimacy remains "integral to her singer-songwriter origins".[379][373] Chris Willman of Variety called Swift "pop's most approachable superstar",[380] and the 21st century's most popular performer.[381]
 Swift emphasizes visuals as a key creative component of her music-making process.[382] She has collaborated with different directors to produce her music videos, and over time, she has become more involved with writing and directing. She developed the concept and treatment for "Mean" in 2011[383] and co-directed the music video for "Mine" with Roman White the year before.[384] In an interview, White said that Swift "was keenly involved in writing the treatment, casting and wardrobe. And she stayed for both the 15-hour shooting days, even when she wasn't in the scenes."[385]
 From 2014 to 2018, Swift collaborated with director Joseph Kahn on eight music videos—four each from her albums 1989 and Reputation. Kahn has praised Swift's involvement.[386] She worked with American Express for the "Blank Space" music video (which Kahn directed) and served as an executive producer for the interactive app AMEX Unstaged: Taylor Swift Experience, for which she won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Interactive Program in 2015.[387] Swift produced the music video for "Bad Blood" and won a Grammy Award for Best Music Video in 2016.[388]
 Her production company, Taylor Swift Productions, is credited with producing all of her visual media, starting with the 2018 concert documentary Reputation Stadium Tour.[389] She continued to co-direct music videos for the Lover singles "Me!" with Dave Meyers, and "You Need to Calm Down" (also serving as a co-executive producer) and "Lover" with Drew Kirsch,[390] but first ventured into sole direction with the video for "The Man" (which won her the MTV Video Music Award for Best Direction).[391] After Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions, Swift debuted as a filmmaker with All Too Well: The Short Film,[203] which made her the first artist to win the Grammy Award for Best Music Video as a sole director.[392] Swift has cited Chloé Zhao, Greta Gerwig, Nora Ephron, Guillermo del Toro, John Cassavetes, and Noah Baumbach as filmmaking influences.[382]
 Swift's discography is a "critically hailed songbook", as per Time's Sam Lansky.[393] She has won 14 Grammy Awards (including four for Album of the Year—the most won by an artist),[394] an Emmy Award,[395] 40 American Music Awards (the most won by an artist),[396] 49 Billboard Music Awards (the most won by an artist),[397] 118 Guinness World Records,[398] 30 MTV Video Music Awards (including five Video of the Year wins—the most by an act),[399] 12 Country Music Association Awards (including the Pinnacle Award),[400] eight Academy of Country Music Awards,[401] and two Brit Awards.[147] As a songwriter, she has been honored by the Nashville Songwriters Association,[59][402] the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and the National Music Publishers' Association and was the youngest person on Rolling Stone's list of the 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time in 2015.[403][404] At the 64th BMI Awards in 2016, Swift was the first woman to be honored with an award named after its recipient.[405]
 From available data, Swift has amassed over 50 million album sales and 150 million single sales as of 2019,[406][407][408] and 114 million units globally, including 78 billion streams as of 2021.[409][410] The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry ranked her as the Global Recording Artist of the Year for a record five times (2014, 2019, 2022, 2023, and 2024).[411] Swift has the most number-one albums in the UK and Ireland for a female artist this century,[412][413] earned the highest income for an artist on Chinese digital music platforms (CN¥ 159,000,000 as of 2021),[414] and is the first artist to occupy the entire top five[note 2] of the Australian albums chart[417][418] and the top ten of the country's singles chart.[419] Swift remains the world's highest-grossing touring act ever, with cumulative ticket sales at $3.12 billion as of December 2024, per Pollstar.[420] The Eras Tour is the highest-grossing tour of all time and the first to surpass $1 billion in revenue.[421][229] Beginning with Fearless, each of her studio albums have opened with over one million global units.[422][423] Swift is the most-streamed act on Spotify,[424] and the most-streamed female artist on Apple Music.[425] On Spotify, she is the only female act to amass 100 billion streams,[426] the only artist to have received more than 250 million and 350 million streams in one day (260 million on October 27, 2023, and 380 million on April 19, 2024),[427] and was the first female act to reach 100 million monthly listeners.[428][198] The most entries and the most simultaneous entries (175 and 34 songs), and most number-ones (5) for a soloist on the Billboard Global 200, are among her feats.[429][430] Swift is the first and only artist to occupy the top nine spots on the Global 200.[429] She has the most entries (154), top-ten songs (20), and number-ones (3)[note 3] among solo acts on the Global 200 Excl. US.[429]
 In the US, Swift has sold over 37.3 million albums as of 2019,[408] when Billboard placed her eighth on its Greatest of All Time Artists Chart.[431] Twelve of her songs have topped the Billboard Hot 100.[432] She is the longest-reigning and the first act to spend at least 100 weeks atop the Billboard Artist 100 (124 weeks);[433][434] the soloist with the most cumulative weeks atop and in the top ten of the Billboard 200 (84 and 425);[435][436] the woman with the most Billboard 200 number-ones (14),[437] Hot 100 entries (total and single-week: 264 and 32),[438] number-one debuts (7),[note 4] top-ten songs (59),[432] top-five songs (36),[198] Streaming Songs chart-toppers (9),[432] and weeks atop the Top Country Albums chart (101);[440] and the act with the most number-one songs on Pop Airplay (13)[441] and Digital Songs (29).[432] Swift is the first woman to simultaneously chart five albums in the top 10 and eleven albums on the entire Billboard 200;[442][443] and the first act to occupy the top four spots and chart seven albums[note 5] in the top 10 on the Top Album Sales chart.[445][446] She is the third highest-certified female digital singles artist (and seventh overall) in the US, with 137.5 million total units certified by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA),[447] and the first woman to have both an album (Fearless) and a song ("Shake It Off") certified Diamond.[448] Swift is the only artist in Luminate history to have seven albums sell over a million copies in a week.[449]
 Swift has appeared in various power listings. Time included her on its annual list of the 100 most influential people in 2010, 2015, and 2019.[450] She was one of the "Silence Breakers" that the magazine spotlighted as Person of the Year in 2017 for speaking up about sexual assault,[451] and she received the honor again in 2023 for her cultural domination that year.[393] Rolling Stone ranked Swift at 102 on their list of 200 Best Singers of All Time in 2023.[452] Time described Swift as the first Person of the Year to be recognized for "achievement in the arts", as well as the first woman to be recognized and appear on a Person of the Year cover more than once.[453][393] She received an honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degree from New York University and served as its commencement speaker on May 18, 2022.[203]
 Swift has been credited with making a profound impact on the music industry, popular culture, and the economy.[454][455] She dominates cultural conversations,[456][457] leading some publications to describe her as a cultural "vitality" or zeitgeist.[458][459][362] Her music, life, and public image are points of attention in global celebrity culture.[290] Initially a teen idol,[460] she has been referred to as a pop icon;[278][461] publications describe her enormous popularity and longevity as unwitnessed since the 20th century.[462][463] In 2013, New York magazine's Jody Rosen dubbed Swift the "world's biggest pop star" and opined that the trajectory of her stardom has defied established patterns. Rosen added that Swift "falls between genres, eras, demographics, paradigms, trends", leaving her contemporaries "vying for second place".[293] Critics regard Swift as a rare yet successful combination of the pop star and singer-songwriter archetypes.[464]
 Swift's fans are known as Swifties.[228] Billboard noted that only a few artists have achieved her level of chart success, critical acclaim, and fan support.[465] Swift's million-selling albums are considered an anomaly in the streaming-dominated industry following the end of the album era in the 2010s.[466][467] Economist Alan Krueger described Swift as an "economic genius".[468]
 Although labeled by the media in her early career as "America's Sweetheart" for her girl next door persona,[469][470] Swift has been called by detractors "calculated" and manipulative of her image, a narrative bolstered by her 2016 dispute with West.[471][472] Critics have also noted that her personal life and career have been subject to intense misogyny and "slut-shaming",[473][474] as well as rampant media scrutiny and tabloid speculation.[475] Swift has also been a victim of numerous house break-ins and stalkers, some of whom were armed.[476][477]
 Swift's private jet use has drawn scrutiny for its carbon emissions.[478][479] In 2023, a spokesperson for Swift stated that she had purchased more than double the required carbon credits to offset all tour travel and personal flights.[480][481] In December 2023, Swift's lawyers sent a cease and desist letter to American programmer Jack Sweeney over tracking her private jet, alleging stalking and safety risks; media outlets have reported that the information posted by Sweeney is a synthesis of publicly available data.[482][483] In February 2024, it was reported that Swift had sold one of her two private jets.[484]
 "You have different artists dominating different sectors of the industry: Some are huge at streaming, some are big draws on the road. But we're at this moment where there's no one better than Taylor Swift, whether that's on the radio, with streaming, ticket sales or just cultural impact."
 Swift helped shape the modern country music scene,[486] having extended her success beyond the Anglosphere,[293][486] pioneered the use of the internet (Myspace) as a marketing tool,[27][47] and introduced the genre to a younger generation.[487][293] Country labels have since become interested in signing young singers who write their own music;[488] her guitar performances contributed to the "Taylor Swift factor": a phenomenon to which an upsurge in guitar sales to women, a previously ignored demographic, is attributed.[489][490]
 According to Pitchfork, Swift changed the music landscape with her genre transitions, a discography that accommodates cultural shifts,[491] and Billboard notes her ability to popularize any sound in mainstream music.[492] Lyrically, in being personal and vulnerable in her songs, music journalist Nick Catucci opined Swift helped make space for later singers like Billie Eilish, Ariana Grande, and Halsey to do the same.[174] Scholars have highlighted the literary sensibility and poptimist implications of Swift.[325][493] She has been credited with legitimizing and popularizing the concept of album "eras".[494][495] Swift is a subject of academic study and scholarly media research.[290] Various educational institutions offer courses on Swift in literary, cultural, and sociopolitical contexts.[496][290]
 Swift has influenced numerous music artists, and her albums have inspired a generation of singer-songwriters.[487][284][497] Journalists praise her ability to reform industry practices, noting how her actions changed streaming policies, prompted awareness of intellectual property in new musicians,[498][499] and reshaped ticketing models.[500] Various sources deem Swift's music a paradigm representing the millennial generation;[501] Vox and The Daily Telegraph likened her to Bruce Springsteen,[502][338] and The Times named her "the Bob Dylan of our age".[503] Swift earned the title Woman of the Decade (2010s) from Billboard,[504] Artist of the Decade (2010s) at the American Music Awards,[505] and Global Icon at the Brit Awards for her impact.[410] Senior artists such as Madonna,[506] Stevie Nicks,[507] Jon Bon Jovi,[508] Dolly Parton,[509] and Elton John have praised her musicianship.[510] Carole King regards Swift as her "professional granddaughter" and thanked Swift for "carrying the torch forward".[511] Springsteen called her a "tremendous" writer,[512] while Elvis Costello compared Swift's songwriting to that of Bob Dylan,[513] and Billy Joel considered Swift the Beatles' successor.[514] Britney Spears labeled Swift "the most iconic pop woman of our generation".[515]

Forbes had previously named her the annual top-earning female musician in 2016, 2019, 2021, and 2022.[561] She was the highest-paid celebrity of 2016 with $170 million—a feat recognized by Guinness World Records as the highest annual earnings ever for a female musician,[562] which she herself surpassed with $185 million in 2019.[563] Overall, Swift was listed as the Forbes highest-paid female artist of the 2010s, earning $825 million.[564] She has also developed a real estate portfolio worth $150 million as of 2023, with residential properties in Nashville, New York City, Los Angeles (Samuel Goldwyn Estate), and Rhode Island (High Watch).[565]

 She is a supporter of the arts. A benefactor of the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame,[589] Swift has donated $75,000 to Nashville's Hendersonville High School to help refurbish the school auditorium,[590] $4 million to build a new education center at the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum in Nashville,[591] and $100,000 to the Nashville Symphony.[592] In 2012, Swift partnered with Chegg for Good to donate $10,000 to the music departments of six US colleges.[593]

Taylor Swift has been one of the most influential artists in contemporary music since she was named the best new artist by the Country Music Association in 2007. In 2023 she was named Spotify’s most-played artist, and in 2024 she became the only person ever to win the Grammy Award for album of the year four times. Taylor Swift was born in West Reading, Pennsylvania. When she was 13, her parents sold their family farm in Pennsylvania and moved to Hendersonville, Tennessee, so she could pursue a career in country music in nearby Nashville. In 2004, at age 14, Taylor Swift signed a music publishing deal with Sony/ATV, thereby becoming the youngest signing in the company’s history. In 2006 Swift signed with Big Machine Records and scored her first Top 40 hit with “Tim McGraw.” She then released four more singles and a self-titled album that quickly sold more than one million copies. In 2007 she was named best new artist by the Country Music Association. Taylor Swift (born December 13, 1989, West Reading, Pennsylvania, U.S.) is a multitalented singer-songwriter and global superstar who has captivated audiences with her heartfelt lyrics and catchy melodies, solidifying herself as one of the most influential artists in contemporary music. In 2024 she made history when she won the Grammy Award for album of the year for Midnights (2022), becoming the first artist to win in that category four times. Later that year she broke the record for the highest-grossing concert tour when her global Eras Tour wrapped up in December, having earned a whopping $2 billion. Swift showed an interest in music at an early age, and she progressed quickly from roles in children’s theater to her first appearance before a crowd of thousands. She was age 11 when she sang “The Star-Spangled Banner” before a Philadelphia 76ers basketball game, and the following year she picked up the guitar and began to write songs. Taking her inspiration from country music artists such as Shania Twain and the Dixie Chicks (now the Chicks), Swift crafted original material that reflected her experiences of tween alienation. When she was 13, Swift’s parents sold their farm in Pennsylvania to move to Hendersonville, Tennessee, so she could devote more of her time to courting country labels in nearby Nashville. Taylor Swift has been named Time’s “Person of the Year” twice. Who appeared on the covers with her? A development deal with RCA Records allowed Swift to make the acquaintance of recording-industry veterans, and in 2004, at age 14, she signed with Sony/ATV as a songwriter. At venues in the Nashville area, she performed many of the songs she had written, and it was at one such performance that she was noticed by record executive Scott Borchetta. Borchetta signed Swift to his fledgling Big Machine label, and her first single, “Tim McGraw” (inspired by and prominently referencing a song by Swift’s favorite country artist), was released in the summer of 2006. The song was an immediate success, spending eight months on the Billboard country singles chart. Now age 16, Swift followed with a self-titled debut album, and she went on tour, opening for Rascal Flatts. Taylor Swift was certified platinum in 2007, having sold more than one million copies in the United States, and Swift continued a rigorous touring schedule, opening for artists such as George Strait, Kenny Chesney, Tim McGraw, and Faith Hill. That November Swift received the Horizon Award for best new artist from the Country Music Association (CMA), capping the year in which she emerged as country music’s most-visible young star. On Swift’s second album, Fearless (2008), she demonstrated a refined pop sensibility, managing to court the mainstream pop audience without losing sight of her country roots. With sales of more than half a million copies in its first week, Fearless opened at number one on the Billboard 200 chart. It ultimately spent more time atop that chart than any other album released that decade. Singles such as “You Belong with Me” and “Love Story” were popular in the digital market as well, the latter accounting for more than four million paid downloads. In 2009 Swift embarked on her first tour as a headliner, playing to sold-out venues across North America. That year also saw Swift dominate the industry award circuit. Fearless was recognized as album of the year by the Academy of Country Music in April, and she topped the best female video category for “You Belong with Me” at the MTV Video Music Awards (VMAs) in September. During her VMA acceptance speech, Swift was interrupted by rapper Kanye West, who protested that the award should have gone to Beyoncé for what he called “one of the best videos of all time.” Later in the program, when Beyoncé was accepting the award for video of the year, she invited Swift onstage to conclude her speech, a move that drew a standing ovation for both performers. At the CMA Awards that November, Swift won all four categories in which she was nominated. Her recognition as CMA entertainer of the year made her the youngest-ever winner of that award, as well as the first female solo artist to win since 1999. She began 2010 with an impressive showing at the Grammy Awards, where she collected four honors, including best country song, best country album, and the top prize of album of the year. Later that year Swift made her feature-film debut in the romantic comedy Valentine’s Day and was named the new spokesperson for CoverGirl cosmetics. Although Swift avoided discussing her personal life in interviews, she was surprisingly frank in her music. Her third album, Speak Now (2010), was littered with allusions to romantic relationships with John Mayer, Joe Jonas of the Jonas Brothers, and Twilight series actor Taylor Lautner. Swift reclaimed the CMA entertainer of the year award in 2011, and the following year she won Grammys for best country solo performance and best country song for “Mean,” a single from Speak Now. Swift continued her acting career with a voice role in the animated Dr. Seuss’ The Lorax (2012) before releasing her next collection of songs, Red (2012). While she remained focused on the vagaries of young love, her songwriting reflected a deepened perspective on the subject, and much of the album embraced a bold pop-rock sound. In its first week on sale in the United States, Red sold 1.2 million copies—the highest one-week total in 10 years. In addition, its lead single, the gleeful “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,” gave Swift her first number-one hit on the Billboard pop singles chart. In 2014 Swift released 1989, an album titled after the year of her birth and reportedly inspired by the music of that era. Although Swift had already been steadily moving away from the traditional country signifiers that marked her early work—“I Knew You Were Trouble,” the second single from Red, even flirted with electronic dance music—she called 1989 her first “official pop album.” On the strength of the upbeat “Shake It Off,” the album proved to be another blockbuster for Swift, its first-week sales surpassing those of Red. It went on to sell more than five million copies in the United States and earned Swift her second Grammy for album of the year. In 2014 Swift also appeared in a supporting role in The Giver, a film adaptation of Lois Lowry’s dystopian novel for young readers. In 2016 Swift’s feud with Kanye West resumed after he released the single “Famous.” The song included a lyric in which Swift was referred to as a “bitch,” and she alleged that it was misogynistic. The public spat escalated after West’s wife, Kim Kardashian, released a recording of a phone call in which Swift gave her approval for the line, though West made no mention of calling her a bitch. Swift’s controversies continued as she took part in a widely publicized civil trial in August 2017, after former radio host David Mueller sued the singer, her mother, and a promoter, claiming that Swift had falsely accused him of sexually groping her in 2013 during the taking of a photograph and thus destroyed his career. She countersued, maintaining that the assault had taken place. At the trial, Swift was removed from Mueller’s suit and the other two defendants were found not liable as the jury found in favor of Swift’s countersuit. Shortly thereafter Swift released the hit song “Look What You Made Me Do,” and her album Reputation became the top-selling American LP of 2017. In 2018 Swift left Big Machine and signed with Republic Records and Universal Music Group. The following year her former label, which owned the master recordings of her six albums, was sold to Scooter Braun, a talent manager whose clients had included Kanye West. Swift publicly spoke out against the deal, claiming that Borchetta had rejected her attempts to acquire the master tapes and that Braun had bullied her over the years. She subsequently tried to negotiate a deal with Braun, but he sold her back catalog to a private investment firm in 2020. Against this backdrop, Swift began rerecording her early material in an effort to gain control of it—the hope being that her remade songs and not the originals would be sought out for licensing deals—and in 2021 Fearless (Taylor’s Version) and Red (Taylor’s Version) appeared. They were remakes of earlier albums with several previously unreleased tracks. In July 2023 Swift released Speak Now (Taylor’s Version), followed by 1989 (Taylor’s Version) in October that same year. In 2019 Swift released her seventh album, Lover, which she described as “a love letter to love itself.” That year she also appeared in the musical Cats, a film adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s hugely successful stage production. Miss Americana (2020) is a documentary about her life and career. With little advance notice, she released Folklore in 2020. A departure from her previous pop-inspired work, Swift’s eighth studio album drew praise for its introspection and restraint, and it won the Grammy for album of the year. The “sister record,” Evermore, appeared later in 2020. Swift adopted a synth-pop sound for the candid Midnights (2022), which she described as “the story of 13 sleepless nights scattered throughout my life.” The album received six Grammy nominations, scoring wins for album of the year and best pop vocal album. March 2023 marked the start of Swift’s first concert tour since 2018, her sixth tour overall. When ticket sales for the Eras Tour opened on Ticketmaster in November 2022, many fans were disappointed by technical issues and waits that lasted up to multiple days. After two rounds of presales, general sales were canceled due to unprecedented demand. Swift expressed disappointment about the situation but did not mention Ticketmaster in her response. In December 2023, Swift was honored as Time magazine’s “Person of the Year.” Finalists also included Barbie, Vladimir Putin, and Sam Altman. The honor came shortly after the music streaming platform Spotify deemed her its most-played artist. According to a Bloomberg analysis, Swift is now a billionaire, with a net worth of around $1.1 billion. On a Forbes list of the most powerful women of 2023, Swift placed fifth. Also in 2023, Swift began dating American football player Travis Kelce of the Kansas City Chiefs. In February 2024, while accepting one of her awards during the Grammy Awards telecast, Swift announced that she would be releasing her next studio album, The Tortured Poets Department, in April. The album was released as a double LP, the 15-track second part dubbed The Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology. Guest artists include Post Malone on the single “Fortnight” and Florence Welch on the track “Florida!!!” At the 2024 MTV Video Music Awards (VMAs), Swift received seven awards, bringing her total count up to 30 and tying her with Beyoncé for solo artist with the most VMAs won during their career. She also left the awards with the most VMAs for best director (for “Fortnight”). She had previously been tied with three VMAs with directors David Fincher and Spike Jonze. In September 2024, following a televised presidential debate between contenders Vice Pres. Kamala Harris and former Pres. Donald Trump, Swift posted a statement on Instagram in which she endorsed Harris. In her statement, she acknowledged the deepfakes created that had falsely portrayed her as a Trump supporter. She said that she was endorsing Harris because “she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them.” Swift closed the year with her final date, on December 8 in Vancouver, of the 21-month Eras Tour, the highest-grossing tour in history. It earned more than $2 billion, double the gross ticket sales for any other concert tour. Fourteen-time Grammy winner Taylor Swift is one of the biggest pop music stars in the world. We may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we back. Hours ahead of her 35th birthday, Taylor Swift had cause for celebration. Beyond winning 10 trophies at the 2024 Billboard Music Awards on December 12, the pop star became the most decorated artist in the award show’s history. Her 49 career wins pushed her ahead of Drake, whom she tied in 2023. Among her haul this year were titles for Top Artist, Top Female Artist, and Top Billboard Global Artist (excluding the United States). Swift is the first person to claim Top Artist four times, according to Billboard. She previously won in 2013, 2015, and 2023. Winners are determined by their performance on various Billboard charts. This year, Swift racked up 32 new songs on the Billboard Hot 100, including her 12th chart-topper in “Fortnight,” following the April release of The Tortured Poets Department. Her newest album spent 16 weeks leading the Billboard 200, a personal best.  Three days before the awards show, Swift wrapped her massively successful Eras Tour. It’s the highest-grossing tour in history, with The New York Times reporting it sold more than $2 billion in tickets. Even more hardware could be in store for Swift come the 2025 Grammy Awards in February. Her six nominations include Album of the Year for Tortured Poets as well as Song of the Year and Record of the Year for “Fortnight.” Another trophy in the best album category would extend her record to five. The 14-time Grammy winner has never won the top song and recording prizes. Musician Taylor Swift began earning renown as a country singer at age 16 and has since become one of the biggest stars in pop music history. Early hits like “Love Story” and “You Belong With Me” appealed to country and pop fans alike and helped fuel the multiplatinum success of her albums, including the award-winning Fearless. Now a pop megastar with 14 Grammys, she is the first artist to win Album of the Year four times. The “Shake It Off” and “Anti-Hero” singer released her latest album, The Tortured Poets Department, in April 2024 and concluded her record-breaking Eras Tour in December. Swift is currently dating professional football player Travis Kelce. FULL NAME: Taylor Alison SwiftBORN: December 13, 1989BIRTHPLACE: Reading, PennsylvaniaASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Sagittarius Taylor Alison Swift was born in Reading, Pennsylvania, on December 13, 1989. Swift spent her early years with her parents, Scott and Andrea, and brother, Austin, on the family’s Christmas tree farm in nearby Wyomissing. “I had the most magical childhood, running free and going anywhere I wanted to in my head,” she told Rolling Stone. She learned to ride horses and competed, but a greater passion soon took root.  Swift followed in the musical footsteps of her grandmother Marjorie Finlay, a professional opera singer. By age 10, Swift sang at various local events, including fairs and contests. She sang “The Star-Spangled Banner” at a Philadelphia 76ers basketball game at age 11 and began learning guitar and writing her own songs at 12. (Her songwriting parallels the poetry of her distant cousin Emily Dickinson.) Her early music idols included Shania Twain and The Chicks. To pursue her music career, Swift often visited Nashville, Tennessee, the country music capital. There, she co-wrote songs and tried to land a recording contract. Noting her dedication, her family moved to nearby Hendersonville when she was 13 in an attempt to further young Swift’s career. She attended Hendersonville High School before finishing her education through the homeschooling program of Aaron Academy, a private Christian school, once her musical career took off. One of today’s biggest pop stars, Swift has worked her way from performing at local venues in Tennessee to commanding stadiums full of Swifties—her adoring fans—on international tours. A stellar performance at The Bluebird Café in Nashville helped her get a contract with Scott Borchetta’s Big Machine Records at age 14. She spent her early career as a country musician, and her first single, “Tim McGraw,” was named after one of the genre’s biggest stars. The 2006 song, which she wrote in her first-year math class, became a Top 10 hit on Billboard’s country charts, quickly launching Swift into the spotlight. McGraw and fellow country music singer Faith Hill even brought Swift on their Soul2Soul tour the next year as an opening act. Reminiscing on the tour years later, McGraw told ET Canada, “Faith and I both knew that there was no stopping her. She’s a special talent.” It wasn’t long before Swift began receiving critical praise for her work. The teenager won the Horizon Award from the Country Music Association (CMA) and the Academy of Country Music (ACM) Award for Top New Female Vocalist in 2007. The following year, she was nominated for Best New Artist at the Grammys. She became the youngest artist to win the Grammy for Album of the Year for Fearless in 2010. The country music darling eventually began experimenting with genre. With her fifth album, 1989, she decisively reintroduced herself as a pop musician. Her new sound excited fans, and the 2014 release is one of her most successful to date, spending 11 weeks atop the Billboard 200 and selling more than 1.2 million copies in its first week. Not everything about her music changed, though. Personal experiences, including her romantic relationships, continue to fuel Swift’s songwriting. “I’m enthralled by relationships, and I love the drama in them, but that’s usually where it lives,” Swift told Rolling Stone in 2009, maintaining “I’m not a dramatic person.” Hardly the first musician to utilize this practice, the pop star usually doesn’t reveal who her song subjects. Instead, her loyal fans obsess over easter eggs in her lyrics and music videos to pinpoint a likely person. In March 2023, Swift began her headline-grabbing Eras Tour. It marked her sixth international tour, having first headlined her own concert series after releasing her sophomore album, Fearless. When presale tickets for the Eras Tour went live in November 2022, so many fans attempted to snag seats that Ticketmaster canceled the general sale, leading to a congressional hearing about the debacle. The intense demand made the Eras Tour the first to sell more than $1 billion in tickets, shattering Elton John’s previous record for highest-grossing tour in history at $939.1 million. Swift’s successes in 2023 also include: the release of the 1989 (Taylor’s Version) album, the record-setting concert film Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour, two more No. 1 songs on the Billboard Hot 100, tying with Drake as the artist with the most Billboard Music Awards in history, dethroning Bad Bunny as Spotify’s and Apple Music’s most streamed artist of the year, and achieving billionaire status. All that culminated in Time naming her its 2023 Person of the Year. Swift is the fifth woman to receive the honor.  Early in 2024, Swift became the first artist to win the Grammy for Album of the Year four times, further cementing her place in the history books. She continued on the Eras Tour, mostly performing abroad, but was forced to cancel three appearances in Vienna after plans for terrorist attacks emerged. Her final stop was in Vancouver, Canada, in early December. After two years and 149 concerts, the Eras Tour totaled more than $2.077 billion in ticket sales. Elsewhere, she defended her titles as the most streamed artist of 2024 on Spotify and Apple Music then became the most awarded artist in Billboard Music Award history with 49 trophies.  Swift has won 14 Grammy Awards out of 58 nominations. This includes six nominations for the 2025 ceremony. The Tortured Poets Department is competing for Album of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album. “Fortnight” could win Song of the Year, Record of the Year, and/or Best Music Video. Swift’s final nod is in the Best Pop Duo/Group Performance category for her featured part on Gracie Abrams’ song “us.” The singer was first nominated in 2008 for Best New Artist. Although Amy Winehouse claimed the honor, 20-year-old Swift lived up to her promising career start by collecting four Grammys the following year. Fearless won Album of the Year and Best Country Album, and “White Horse” was named Best Country Song and Best Female Country Vocal Performance in 2009. Swift has now won Album of the Year four times: for Fearless, 1989, folklore, and Midnights. She is the only artist to have accomplished this feat, setting the record in 2024, and the only female musician to have been nominated in the category seven times. The artist has never won the top song honor of Song of the Year, though she has received a record eight nominations in the category. As for Best Country Song, Swift has won twice in five nominations; “Mean” earned the trophy the year after “White Horse” did.  The singer-songwriter has won many other accolades, including nine CMA Awards and eight ACM Awards. Both country music organizations have twice named her Entertainer of the Year. Since her first in 2009, Swift has taken home 30 MTV Video Music Awards, matching Beyoncé’s record for most wins. Billboard called her Woman of the Year in 2011 and 2014, two of Swift’s 49 awards from the publication. In 2024, she surpassed Drake as the artist with the most Billboard Music Awards trophies. In December 2023, Swift notched another first when she received her first Golden Globe Award nomination for Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour. Her concert film competed in but didn’t win Cinematic and Box Office Achievement at the January 2024 ceremony. Since her first single, “Tim McGraw,” in 2006, Swift’s music has found a home on the Billboard charts. As of December 13, 2024, she has had 264 songs grace the mainstream Hot 100. That includes 12 No. 1 hits and a record-setting 59 songs in the top 10; no woman has had more top 10 hits, and Swift only trails Drake among all artists. She also holds nine No. 1 Hot Country Songs, including “Our Song” and “Should’ve Said No.” “Fearless” debuted at No. 9 on the mainstream chart in November 2008, marking Swift’s first top 10 song. Her first Billboard Hot 100 chart-topper was roughly four years away. That arrived in September 2012 with Grammy-nominated “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together.” Her other No 1. songs include: At 10 minutes and 13 seconds, “All Too Well (Taylor’s Version)” is the longest No. 1 hit in history. Both “Fearless” and “Shake It Off” are diamond-certified songs, having sold the equivalent of 10 million copies. To date, Swift has released 19 albums, including 11 original studio albums, four rereleases, and four live albums. Excluding those live recordings, every album since her sophomore effort, Fearless, has nabbed the No. 1 spot on the Billboard 200 for at least one week. In December 2023, she became the first living artist to have five albums simultaneously rank among the chart’s top 10. Her first album came in 2006 with Taylor Swift, and her newest album is 2024’s The Tortured Poets Department. Her latest rerecorded album, 1989 (Taylor’s Version), debuted in October 2023. Her albums, in order, are: Taylor Swift The young musician’s self-titled debut album was released in October 2006 when she was 16. Spurred on by the success of songs like “Tim McGraw,” “Teardrops on My Guitar,” and “Our Song,” it became a No. 1 country album in August 2007 and held the top spot for a total of 24 weeks. Indicating her future crossover success, the album also reached No. 5 on the Billboard 200. Taylor Swift has sold more than 7 million copies to date. Fearless In November 2008, Swift released her next album, Fearless, which quickly hit the top of both the country and pop charts, marking her first No. 1 mainstream album. It maintained its apex ranking on the charts for weeks on end. By the end of the year, Swift had become 2008’s highest-selling country artist. Now a diamond-certified album, Fearless earned Swift her first Grammy Awards in January 2010. In addition to Best Country Album, it took home one of the night’s top honors with Album of the Year. The track “White Horse” won Best Country Song and Best Female Country Vocal Performance, while “You Belong With Me” was nominated for three Grammys. Also named Album of the Year at the CMA and ACM Awards, Fearless featured the top 10 hits “Love Story,” “Fearless,” and “Change.”  Speak Now After skeptics doubted her involvement in her songwriting, Swift chose to write her next album alone. Speak Now came out in October 2010 and immediately found success. It debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and sold more than 1 million copies in its first week. Popular tracks included “Mine,” “Back To December,” “Speak Now,” and the Grammy-winning “Mean.” Swift was once again nominated for Best Country Album at the Grammys but didn’t win.  Red Edging her way into pop music, Swift followed with Red, which featured her first No. 1 single “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together” and also topped 1 million in its first week of sales. The October 2012 release collected Grammy nominations for Album of the Year and Best Country Album. “I Knew You Were Trouble,” “Red,” and “Begin Again” were among its most popular songs. 1989 With her next effort, Swift stepped outside her country music roots squarely into mainstream pop. She released 1989 in October 2014. It spent 11 weeks atop the Billboard 200 (matching Swift’s earlier success with Fearless), produced three chart-topping singles, and moved more than 1.2 million copies in its first week. That made Swift the first artist to pass the 1 million mark in opening-week sales for three albums. She won her second Album of the Year award at the Grammys in February 2016 as well as Best Pop Vocal Album for her work. reputation In late August 2017, using an image of a snake, Swift revealed that she would release her sixth studio album, reputation, that November. Swift debuted the first single, “Look What You Made Me Do,” on August 24. In the music video, Swift played characters of all her misrepresentations. The video had more than 19 million views on YouTube within the first day. Days before reputation’s scheduled November 10 release, its secret tracklist was leaked to social media. Swift responded by posting the complete list to her Instagram page: 15 songs, including a collaborative effort with Ed Sheeran and rapper Future titled “End Game.” The two later appeared in the video for the track, which debuted in January 2018. Reputation sold 1.05 million copies in the United States over its first four days. Along with giving the artist her fourth consecutive album to surpass 1 million in sales for its opening week, that total made reputation the top-selling album of 2017. Its success continued into 2018, surpassing 2 million in sales while generating the release of seven singles. By the end of the year, Grammy-nominated reputation had been honored with Favorite Pop/Rock Album at the American Music Awards and Top Selling Album at the Billboard Music Awards. Lover On April 26, 2019, Swift debuted “ME!” with Brendon Urie of Panic! at the Disco, along with a video of the duo singing and dancing amid a panoply of elaborate sets and swirling colors. It became the first single from her seventh studio album, Lover, with “You Need to Calm Down” and the title track also hitting the airwaves as singles over the next few months. The album was released in August. In November, Swift claimed a whopping six wins at the American Music Awards, including Artist of the Year and Artist of the Decade honors. Swift also received her third consecutive Grammy nomination for Best Pop Vocal Album. A few weeks later, it was reported that Lover was the only album to sell 1 million copies in the U.S. in 2019. Nearly four years later, Lover’s “Cruel Summer” was promoted as her latest single amid her highly successful Eras tour. The song enjoyed renewed success, becoming Swift’s 10th song to top the Billboard Hot 100. folklore On July 23, 2020, Swift announced on Instagram that she planned to release her eighth studio album, folklore. The 16-track album—made with Aaron Dessner of The National, Jack Antonoff of Bleachers, and Justin Vernon, better known as Bon Iver—debuted the next day at midnight. The alternative influence of her collaborators was apparent throughout. Folklore produced the top 10 hits “The 1” and “Exile” featuring Bon Iver, plus went on to win Album of the Year at the 2021 Grammys. Swift also made history that year, becoming the only female solo artist to win that award three times. evermore Less than six months later, Swift dropped another surprise album to accompany folklore. She announced on December 10, 2020, that evermore would release at midnight the next day. “To put it plainly, we just couldn’t stop writing songs,” Swift wrote in a social media post. “In the past I’ve always treated albums as one-off eras and moved onto planning the next one after an album was released. There was something different with folklore. In making it, I felt less like I was departing and more like I was returning.” Evermore earned a Grammy nomination for Album of the Year, though unlike its sister album, it didn’t win. Midnights Swift released her 10th studio album, Midnights, at midnight on October 21, 2022. Three hours later, she released seven extra tracks in a deluxe version titled Midnights (3 am Edition). The album broke new ground for the already prolific Swift, making her the first artist to have a song on all of the top 10 slots on the Billboard Hot 100. That included “Anti-Hero” at No. 1, “Snow On The Beach” featuring Lana Del Rey, “Lavender Haze,” and “Karma.” Actor Zoë Kravitz earned writing credits on the latter two songs, and Jack Antonoff played a heavy hand in the album’s creation, cowriting 11 of Midnights’ 13 songs. The album resulted in six Grammy nominations and two wins. Midnights was named the Album of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album. The Tortured Poets Department At the 2024 Grammy Awards, Swift announced her next album, The Tortured Poets Department, would arrive on April 19, 2024. Fans were in for an even bigger surprise early that morning when the singer revealed it was a double-album. The Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology included 15 additional songs, bringing the total to 31 tracks. Within 12 hours of its release, Tortured Poets broke the single-day streaming record on Spotify before becoming the most streamed album across platforms in a single week in history. Fans in the United States streamed the collection more than 891.3 million times, according to data firm Luminate. Its top songs include “Fortnight,” “Down Bad,” and “I Can Do It With A Broken Heart.” Tortured Poets marks Swift’s 14th No. 1 album on the Billboard 200, tying Jay-Z’s record for most among solo artists. Only The Beatles have more, at 19. Moreover, the album was the Billboard 200 leader for 12 consecutive weeks and topped the chart for a total of 16 weeks, a new personal best for Swift. The musician tallied five more Grammy Award nods for her newest work. This includes a record seventh Album of the Year nomination, more than any other woman. Taylor’s Version albums After the master recordings to her first six studio albums were sold in 2019, Swift decided to rerecord her old music to regain artistic and financial control of her catalog. So far, she has released four of six: Fearless (Taylor’s Version) in April 2021, Red (Taylor’s Version) in November 2021, Speak Now (Taylor’s Version) in July 2023, and 1989 (Taylor’s Version) in October 2023. Each included previously unreleased songs labeled as “From The Vault,” some of which she recorded with fellow musicians Keith Urban, Ed Sheeran, Chris Stapleton, and Phoebe Bridgers, among others.  Swift hasn’t shared when she will rerelease Taylor Swift and reputation. When she was 26, Swift was the highest-paid musician—and celebrity of any industry—of 2016 per Forbes, earning $170 million. It was one successful year among many, allowing the pop star to amass a remarkably large net worth. By late October 2023, Swift had become a billionaire, according to Bloomberg. As of December 13, 2024, Forbes estimates Swift has a net worth of $1.6 billion, surpassing Rihanna as the wealthiest female musician. The magazine also reports Swift is the first person to become a billionaire primarily from songwriting and performing. In 2023, she earned an estimated $131 million on Spotify alone, as the platform’s worldwide top-streamed artist of the year. Her wealth has skyrocketed in the past two years, fueled by the pop star’s highly successful Eras Tour. Swift became the first musician to gross over $1 billion on a single tour in December 2023. Ultimately, her production company confirmed to The New York Times that ticket sales totaled $2,077,618,725. In April 2024, before the Eras Tour finished, Forbes noted her estimated take-home from the concert series is $190 million. Swift ranks No. 17 on Pollstar’s list of highest-grossing touring artists since 1980, selling nearly $925 million in tickets from her first five tours and other appearances as of July 2022. The only women higher on the list are Madonna, Celine Dion, and Beyoncé. Contributing to her overall net worth are her real estate holdings. According to Business Insider, her properties total $84 million. She also has lucrative endorsement deals with Capitol One, Stella McCartney, Diet Coke, Apple, and more. Over the years, the musician has shared some of her fortune to help others. For example, in 2013, she funded the $4 million Taylor Swift Education Center at the Country Music Hall of Fame in Nashville. The facility opened with three classrooms, a learning lab, and a space dedicated to exhibits for children. In an interview with CMT Hot 20 Countdown, she explained that “music education is really such an important part of my life. My life changed so completely when I discovered writing my own songs and playing guitar, and that can’t necessarily all be taught to you in school because there aren’t enough hours in the day.” Currently, Swift is dating NFL football player Travis Kelce. On a July 2023 episode of his New Heights podcast, Kelce explained how he tried to give Swift his number on a friendship bracelet after attending the Eras Tour in Kansas City. Soon after, Swift reached out, and they went public with their romance in the fall. “Obviously, I’ve never dated anyone with that kind of aura about them... I’ve never dealt with it,” Kelce told The Wall Street Journal. “But at the same time, I’m not running away from any of it.” Swift attended 12 of his NFL games in the 2023 season and postseason. “By the time I went to that first game, we were a couple,” she told Time. “I think some people think that they saw our first date at that game? We would never be psychotic enough to hard launch a first date.” Kelce returned the support in mid-November 2023, traveling to Buenos Aires, Argentina, to attend one of her concerts on the Eras Tour. During the show, Swift changed one of her lyrics in the song “Karma” to reference Kelce, and the couple were caught kissing on camera for the first time. At a June 2024 concert in London, Kelce briefly joined Swift on stage, helping her complete an outfit change between songs.  With the start of the 2024-25 NFL season, Swift has once again been a fixture at the Kansas City Chiefs home games. Over the years, Swift has dated several celebrities. During much of 2008, reports circulated that she was dating musician Joe Jonas of The Jonas Brothers. The song “Forever & Always” is reportedly about Jonas. The following year, Swift briefly dated actor Taylor Lautner, whom she met while they filmed the 2010 movie Valentine’s Day. Swift then dated fellow singer-songwriter John Mayer for a brief period beginning in late 2009; he’s thought to be the inspiration for her song “Dear John.” From there, Swift was romantically linked to actors Cory Monteith and Jake Gyllenhaal in 2010, then Conor Kennedy—son of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.—in 2012. She celebrated the new year with One Direction’s Harry Styles in 2013, but the relationship ended later that year. In 2015, Swift dated DJ and music producer Calvin Harris, though the couple reportedly broke up in June 2016. Shortly after that, the pop star began dating actor Tom Hiddleston, but the couple split three months later. Swift’s longest relationship to date was with actor Joe Alwyn. The pair met at the 2016 Met Gala and were together from 2017 until spring 2023. Beyond being another boyfriend to spark her songwriting, Alwyn also helped write songs on her folklore, evermore, and Midnights albums under the pseudonym William Bowery. After their breakup, Swift briefly dated musician Matty Healy, lead singer of The 1975 band. In November 2018, Swift signed with Universal Music Group’s Republic Records. The deal granted the musician ownership of her master recordings, something she didn’t have in her agreement with her first label, Big Machine Records.  The next June, Swift revealed her dismay that Big Machine sold her catalog of music from her first six albums, up to reputation, to a company owned by Scooter Braun, the now-retired manager of artists like Justin Bieber and Ariana Grande and a person she accused of bullying tactics. “Scooter has stripped me of my life’s work, that I wasn’t given an opportunity to buy,” she wrote on Tumblr. “Essentially, my musical legacy is about to lie in the hands of someone who tried to dismantle it.” Just before the August 2019 release of Lover, Swift confirmed she would rerecord her old music to regain artistic and financial control of her catalog. Swift’s catalog was sold again, in October 2020, to Shamrock Holdings for around $300 million. In a lengthy post on Twitter (now called X), Swift gave her fans an update: Swift added the deal still allows Braun to profit from her music and that she was in the process of re-recording her old music. Her first rerecorded release, “Love Story (Taylor’s Version),” came in mid-February 2021. So far, she has reissued four of six albums from her early catalog.  Watch Taylor Swift vs. Scooter Braun: Bad Blood, a documentary about their feud, on Max The megastar has been involved in a few legal disputes, which all have gone in her favor. In August 2017, she testified in a trial against David Mueller, a former radio DJ she accused of groping her four years earlier. Mueller denied Swift’s allegations and said the incident cost him his job, which led him to sue Swift, her mother, and a radio station employee in 2015. Swift countersued him for alleged assault and battery, and a jury ruled in her favor in 2017, awarding her $1 in damages as a symbolic gesture. Swift responded to the verdict: “I acknowledge the privilege that I benefit from in life, in society, and in my ability to shoulder the enormous cost of defending myself in a trial like this. My hope is to help those whose voices should also be heard. Therefore, I will be making donations in the near future to multiple organizations that help sexual assault victims defend themselves.” Also in 2017, Swift was on the receiving end of a lawsuit when two songwriters claimed that she stole the chorus of their song “Playas Gon’ Play” for her hit “Shake It Off.” Although a judge dismissed the case in early 2018 on the grounds that the “allegedly infringed lyrics are short phrases that lack the modicum of originality and creativity required for copyright protection,” an appeals court revived the suit in October 2019. Shortly before the trial was scheduled to begin, a judge dismissed the case in December 2022 at the request of both parties. A few media outlets reported a settlement, but if so, the terms weren’t publicly released. The musician was trapped in another copyright lawsuit when a Mississippi woman claimed “a number of creative elements” from her self-published poetry book appeared in Swift’s companion book for her Lover (2019) album. The author sued in August 2022 but voluntarily dropped her case the next July. Beyond her romantic relationships, Swift has had many high-profile friendships—with singer and actor Selena Gomez, model Karlie Kloss, and actor Blake Lively, to name a few—as well as headline-making feuds. Chief among those is her beef with rapper Kanye West. In 2009, when Swift won the MTV Video Music Award’s Best Female Video for “You Belong With Me,” West led to the stage as the young singer gave her acceptance speech. He took the mic and famously declared, “Yo, Taylor, I’m really happy for you, I’mma let you finish, but Beyoncé had one of the best videos of all time!” The stunned Swift could not finish her acceptance speech, and West was removed from the show. When Beyoncé accepted her award for Best Video of the Year later in the night, she called Swift to the stage to finish her speech. West later apologized to Swift privately and publicly on The Jay Leno Show. In early 2016, West released his song “Famous,” which includes a lyric taking credit for her fame and calling her a derogatory word. The rapper said Swift had approved the line in a phone call, though her team initially denied the conversation. Days later, Swift said in a Grammys acceptance speech:  Kim Kardashian, who was married to West then, defended her husband in a GQ interview that summer and released clips of the phone call between the musicians. Although edited, the recordings proved Swift’s PR team had been lying in their initial statement. Kardashian also implied Swift was a snake in a July 2016 social media post. The pop star alluded to the fight in the songs “Look What You Made Me Do” and “This Is Why We Can’t Have Nice Things” from her reputation (2017) album. She has also used snakes in music videos and onstage in concerts. The feud briefly reignited in March 2020 when a 25-minute video of the phone conversation leaked online. Previously having released several concert movies, Swift made a bigger splash with her Netflix documentary Miss Americana. The January 2020 release covered the makings of her recent studio albums as well as other high-profile events like her sexual assault trial. Miss Americana earned a limited run in theaters simultaneously to its streaming release. Swift’s newest concert movie, Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour, capitalizes on her massive star power. The film opened exclusively in theaters—3,850 locations in North America alone—in October 2023. According to Comscore, no other concert movie enjoyed as wide of a release. It also had showtimes in some 90 other countries and grossed more than $261 million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing concert film of all time. Swift sweetened the show for at-home viewers with two extended versions. Disney+ subscribers can watch the Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour (Taylor’s Version), featuring five additional songs. The movie is also available for rent on other streaming platforms with three additional songs.  Swift has also dabbled in acting. She appeared in the 2010 blockbuster Valentine’s Day alongside Julia Roberts, Jamie Foxx, Jessica Biel, Bradley Cooper, and other Hollywood heavyweights. A voice role in The Lorax (2012) and another role in The Giver (2014) followed. In December 2019, Swift was featured in a live-action adaptation of the famed Broadway musical Cats, along with Jennifer Hudson, James Corden, and Rebel Wilson. She also teamed with Cats creator Andrew Lloyd Webber to write a song, “Beautiful Ghosts,” for the movie. Swift also had a cameo in 2022’s Amsterdam.

Her father, Scott Swift, is a stockbroker; her mother, Andrea Swift, is a homemaker who previously worked as a fund marketing executive; and her brother, Austin, is an actor. Swift spent her early years on a Christmas tree farm with her parents.
   At age 9, Swift started taking vocal and acting lessons in New York City and later decided to shift her focus toward country music, inspired by Shania Twain and Faith Hill.
   When the rising star was around 12 years old, a computer repairman named Ronnie Cremer taught her to play guitar and helped with her first efforts as a songwriter, leading Taylor to write "Lucky You", her first song ever. 
   In 2003, with the help of a family friend manager, she modeled for Abercrombie & Fitch and had an original song included on the show's compilation CD. With it, came the opportunity to attend meetings with major record labels. 
   To help Taylor's break into country music, her father transferred his job to an office in Nashville when she was 14, and the family relocated to a lakefront house in Hendersonville, Tennessee, where Taylor attended high school. Two years later, she transferred to Aaron Academy to better accommodate her touring schedule through homeschooling. She graduated high school a year early because of that.   In Nashville, Taylor started working with songwriter Liz Rose during two-hour writing sessions every Tuesday afternoon after school. Later, she became the youngest artist signed by Sony/ATV publishing house, but left the group at age 14. She believed she was running out of time because she wanted to capture the early years of her life on an album while it still represented what she was going through. 
   At a showcase in Nashville's Bluebird Cafe in 2005, Swift caught the attention of Scott Borchetta, a record executive who was preparing to form an independent record label, Big Machine Records. She became one of Big Machine's first signings, with her father purchasing a three percent share of the company. 
   Taylor then started working on her debut album and persuaded Big Machine to hire Nathan Chapman to produce her songs. Her first lead single “Tim McGraw” was released in June 2006, and Taylor Swift’s self titled album was released later that year, on October 24, 2006. It peaked at number 5 on the US Billboard 200, where it spent 275 weeks. Swift was also the opening act for Brad Paisley’s 2007 tour to promote her album and spent 2006 and 2007 doing promotion on radios, television, and being the opening act for country artists in the US. Throughout 2007 and 2008, Taylor released four more singles from her debut album and all of them appeared on Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart.
   Swift released her first two EPs "The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection" and "Beautiful Eyes" in October 2007 and July 2008, respectively, winning accolades for all of her first three projects. 
   She became the youngest person to be honored with the BMI Songwriter of the Year title in 2007. She won awards at the CMAs, ACMs and AMAs while also securing a nomination for Best New Artist at the 50th Grammy Awards.   Swift's sophomore album, Fearless, was released on November 11, 2008. Five singles were released throughout 2008 and 2009, with "Love Story", the lead single, peaking at number 4 on the Billboard Hot 100  chart and number 1 in Australia. The second single, "You Belong With Me", peaked at number 2 in the US. The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and was the top selling album of 2009 in the US. 
   The Fearless Tour – Swift's first headlining concert tour – grossed over $63 million, with Taylor releasing a documentary of the tour that was aired on television and released on DVD. Throughout 2009 and 2010, Swift won multiple awards with her LP at prestigious award shows such as the CMAs and the ACMs, including Artist of the Year at the AMAs and her first Album of the Year statue at the 52nd Grammys, where Swift also bagged another 3 wins. She was named 'Female Artist of the Year' by Billboard back in 2009 as well. 
   Taylor also co-wrote songs with artists such as John Mayer, Boys Like Girls, and Kellie Pickler, and wrote 2 tracks for Disney Channel’s Hannah Montana – "Crazier" and "You'll Always Find Your Way Back Home" – which were featured on the movie’s soundtrack. 
   During Fearless era, Taylor also wrote “Today Was A Fairytale” for the Valentine's Day movie Soundtrack, which peaked at number 2 in the US.    In August 2010, Swift released "Mine”, the lead single from her third studio album, Speak Now. It debuted on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart at number three. Following criticism claiming Taylor’s songwriting was good because she worked with co-writers, Swift wrote all 17 tracks on her third record by herself as well as co-produced every song. 
   The album was released on October 25, 2010, debuting at number 1 on Billboard 200, with 1 million copies sold in its first week. 
   At the 54th Grammy Awards, in 2012, Swift won Best Country Song and Best Country Solo Performance for "Mean", which she performed during the ceremony in response to her much criticized 2010 Grammy performance, serving as a testament to her abilities as a musician. 
  Swift won several awards for Speak Now, including Songwriter of the Year at the BMI Awards, Entertainer of the Year at the ACMs and CMAs, and was named Billboard’s Woman of the Year. The album also received general acclaim from critics, with Rolling Stone praising Taylor abilities as a rockstar. 
   The Speak Now World Tour was done between 2011 and 2012, grossing over $123 million. In November 2011, she released a live album, the “Speak Now World Tour Live". 
   Swift also contributed to The Hunger Games soundtrack with two original songs: “Eyes Open” and “Safe & Sound”, recorded with The Civil Wars. The latter went on to win a Grammy award as well as a Golden Globe nomination. Taylor was featured on BoB's single "Both of Us”, released in May 2012.     In August 2012, Swift released "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together", the lead single from her fourth studio album, RED. It became her first number one in the US and New Zealand, and reached the top spot on iTunes digital song sales chart only 50 minutes after its release. Her third single, "I Knew You Were Trouble”, peaked in the top 5 of the most important music market countries in the world, reaching the 2nd position on Billboard Hot 100. 
   RED was released on October 22, 2012. For this project, Taylor worked with new producers and songwriters, such as Max Martin and Shellback – who would become two of Taylor’s biggest collaborators in the future – as well as Nathan Chapman and Liz Rose, with whom she’d been working since her earlier days. The album incorporates new genres for Swift, like heartland rock, dubstep and dance pop influences. 
   RED debuted at number 1 in the US, with a first week sale of 1.2 million copies, and was Swift's first number 1 album in the UK. The Red Tour ran from March 2013 to June 2014 and grossed over $150 million, becoming the highest grossing country tour when it wrapped. 
   Red earned Swift several accolades, including 4 Grammy nominations, a VMA trophy, multiple AMA statues and a BMI award for Songwriter of the Year. Taylor was also honored by the Country Music Academy with the Pinnacle Award. 
   In 2013, Taylor recorded "Sweeter than Fiction" for the One Chance movie soundtrack. It became her first project with producer Jack Antonoff, who she would continue to work with in the future. Taylor also collaborated with Tim McGraw and Keith Urban in one of the most successful country songs of that year, “Highway Don’t Care”.
      In March of 2014, Taylor moved to New York City while she worked on her fifth studio album, 1989, which would become her most successful and longest-charting record. Influenced by 1980s synth-pop, Swift severed ties with the country sound of her previous albums, and marketed 1989 as her "first documented, official pop album". The album was released on October 27, 2014 and sold 1.28 million copies in the US during the first week of release, debuting at the top of Billboard 200 chart. 
  Three of its singles – “Shake It Off", "Blank Space", and "Bad Blood”, featuring rapper Kendrick Lamar – reached number one in Australia, Canada, and in the US. 
   The 1989 World Tour ran from May to December 2015 and was the highest-grossing tour of the year, with $250 million in total revenue. 
   During this era, Taylor went up against two of the biggest steaming services in the world, Spotify and Apple Music, in an effort to oppose the way these companies payed artists. In November 2014, Swift removed her entire catalog from Spotify, arguing that the streaming company’s ad-supported free service undermined the premium service, which provides higher royalties for songwriters. In June of 2015, Taylor wrote an open letter criticizing Apple Music for not offering royalties to artists during the streaming service's three-month free trial period. The following day, Apple announced that it would pay artists during the free trial period. 
   Swift was named Billboard's Woman of the Year in 2014, and at the 2014 American Music Awards, she received the inaugural Dick Clark Award for Excellence. During this era, Swift also won a BRIT, several VMAs, and multiple other accolades which solidified the 1989 era as the most awarded pop era of all time. 
   At the 58th Grammy Awards in 2016, 1989 won in 3 categories, including Album of the Year. Swift became the first woman and fifth act overall to win Album of the Year twice as a lead artist. 
   Swift co-wrote "This Is What You Came For" with Calvin Harris in 2016, and early in 2017, she collaborated with Zayn Malik on “I Don’t Wanna Live Forever”, for the Fifty Shades Darker soundtrack. The song reached number two in the US and won Best Collaboration at the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards.
   "Better Man”, a song Taylor had written during Red era, was released on Little Big Town's seventh album, The Breaker, and earned Swift an award for Song of the Year at the 51st CMA Awards in 2017.    After disappearing from social media and the public eye during most of 2016, Swift executed one of the most successful comebacks in history with her sixth studio album, reputation. “Look What You Made Me Do” was released as the albums’s lead single and its music video broke the record for the most views in the first 24 hours of release.
   The album was released on November 10, 2017 and incorporated a heavy electropop sound, with hip hop, R&B and EDM influences. It debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200, with first-week sales of 1.21 million copies. With this achievement, Swift became the first act to have four albums sell one million copies within one week in the US. The project spawned three other international singles, including the US top-five entry "...Ready for It?". 
   In support of reputation, she embarked on her reputation Stadium Tour, which ran from May to November 2018. In the US, the tour grossed $266.1 million in box office and sold over two million tickets, breaking Swift's own record for the highest-grossing US tour by a woman, which was previously held by her 1989 World Tour ($181.5 million). It also became the highest-grossing North American concert tour in history. Worldwide, the tour grossed $345.7 million. On December 31st, Swift released the reputation Stadium Tour concert film on Netflix. 
   Reputation was nominated for Best Pop Vocal Album at the 61st Grammy Awards in 2019. At the 2018 AMAs, Swift won four awards, including Artist of the Year and Favorite Pop/Rock Female Artist. After the 2018 ceremony, Swift garnered a total of 23 awards, becoming the most awarded female musician in AMA history.     In November 2018, Taylor signed a new multi-album deal with Universal Music Group and her subsequent releases would be promoted under the Republic Records imprint. The contract included a provision for her to maintain ownership of her masters recordings. Her seventh album would become the first studio album owned by Swift.
   Lover was released on August 23, 2019 and became Taylor’s sixth consecutive album to sell over 500,000 copies in its first week in the US, making Swift the first female artist to achieve this. All 18 songs from the album charted on the Billboard Hot 100 in the same week, setting a record for the most simultaneous entries by a woman. Lover was the world's best-selling solo studio album of 2019, selling 3.2 million copies. 
   The album earned multiple accolades, including 3 nominations at the Grammys, 3 VMAs and 6 AMAs. Swift also became the first female artist to win Artist of the Decade at the American Music Awards.
   Taylor starred as Bombalurina in the movie adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical, Cats. She co-wrote and recorded an original song for the movie called "Beautiful Ghosts”, which would earn her another Golden Globe nod & a Grammy nomination at the 63rd Annual GRAMMY Awards.
   The documentary 'Miss Americana', which chronicles part of her life and career over the years, premiered at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival and was released on Netflix in January 2020. Miss Americana features the original song "Only the Young", which Swift wrote after the 2018 United States presidential elections. 
   During promotion for Lover in 2019, Swift became embroiled in a publicized dispute with manager Scooter Braun and her former label Big Machine regarding the acquisition of the masters of her back catalog. She stated she had been trying to buy the masters for years, but Big Machine only allowed her to do so if she exchanged a new album for an older one under another contract, which she chose not to sign. In October 2019, Swift's masters, videos and artworks were sold to Shamrock Holdings for a reported $300 million. Swift began re-recording her back catalog in November 2020 in an effort to own and be in control of her music and life’s work.      On July 23, 2020, Swift surprise-announced she would be releasing her eighth studio album, folklore, at midnight. The album debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200 and became the year's longest-running no. 1, with 8 non-consecutive weeks at the top of the chart. The album’s lead single “cardigan” also debuted at #1. 
   Made in isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic, folklore was the result of a collaboration with long-time musical partner Jack Antonoff, Aaron Dessner, from The National, with whom Taylor had never worked before, and Bon Iver who are featured in one of the album’s tracks.
   In November 2020, Swift released the self-directed “folklore: the long pond studio sessions” on Disney+, a documentary in which Taylor, Aaron and Jack perform all the songs from the record while discussing the meanings and inspirations behind the album.
   Folklore earned Swift 5 nominations at the Grammys, including Album and Song of the Year. Taylor won the Album of the Year statue, becoming the first woman to win the Grammy’s highest honor three times.
   On December 10, 2020, Swift once again surprised her fans with the announcement of her ninth studio album and folklore’s sister record, evermore.
